# concrete_strength-analysis-using-Regeression
Developed a simple 3 hidden layer neural network, for concrerte strength analysis.

Part A: Here built a simple neural network with One hidden layer of 10 nodes and a ReLU activation function.

        1) Used adam optimizer and the mean squared error as the loss function.
        
        2) Found the mean and the standard deviation of the mean squared errors.
        
        3)  Trained for 50 epochs. 
        
Part B: Here used the normalized version of the data for the Part A.

Part C: Here trained for 100 epochs.

Part D: Here built a three hidden layers each of 10 nodes and ReLU as activation function.
